#Homework One
#Hi Proffesor,
#Thank you for sharing the videos of interest in discord, following the news of China coming up with their own AI system, the idea that they might be working with stolen extraterristrial technology doesnt seem to far off. 
#Also, while irrelevant to technology, it's also a reminder that China was able to spend a fraction of what the US invested (5m vs 500B) because China is a communist country and they get to dictate the price of goods. Same reason why a doseage of insulin cost $10-$30 in China, while the same cost $100-$300 here.
